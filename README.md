-  Demographic matter : younger employees and those with fewer years at the company are more likely to leave
-  Compensation is critical : Employees with lower salaries or pay rates show higher attrition
-  Job Satisfication & work-life balance : low satisfication and poor balance are consistent predictors of turnover

###### INTERPRETATION
-  Attrition Rate : The dataset typically shows the percentage of employees who left verses those who stayed. A high attrition rate signals potential issues in retention strategies
-  Demographics : Younger employees and those with shorter tenure often appear more likely to leave,suggesting the need for stronger onboarding and career development programs
-  Compensation & Benefits : Employees with lower salaries or fewer benefits tend to leave more often. This indicates that competitive compensation is a critical retention tool.

###### RECOMMENDATION AND ACTION POINTS
-  Enhance compensation and benefits
-  Promote career growth opportunities

###### CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY
